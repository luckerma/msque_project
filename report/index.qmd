# Introduction

# Configuration

## Step 1

### Simulate and measure the transmission rate.

### Is the inter-arrival time for the packets memoryless? Explain your answer.

### Compute the total number of packets transmitted during the simulation time. Explain why the transmission rate was around 660 kbps.

### Reproduce the simulation and confirm that the results remain consistent.

### Modify the random number generator seed in `omnetpp.ini`. How does changing the seed impact the simulation results?

### List all parameters of the MAC protocol used in `AckingWirelessInterface` with references to the source code.

### Explain the `throughput:vector` statistic in the analysis ﬁle by citing its definition and implementation in the source code.

## Step 2

### Visualize the radio transmission range.

### Change the communication range so that host B is no longer reachable from host A. Visualize the new range.

### Provide simulation results for the transmission rate and explain them.

## Step 3

### Identify the type of wireless interfaces for the new hosts. Explain your answer with references to the source code.

## Step 4

### Use the runtime GUI to capture a screenshot showing the IP addresses of all hosts in the network.

## Step 5 {#sec-step_5}

### Enable event log recording in the runtime GUI.

### Open the `.elog` ﬁle with a text editor and explain its contents.

### Analyze the event log using the sequence chart and event log table tools. Filter events for `hostA+udp`, `hostB+udp`, and `hostR1+ip`.

### Take screenshots and comment on both a complete and an incomplete transmission sequence chart.

## Step 6 {#sec-step_6}

### 1. Compare the number of packets received by host B in this configuration with the results from `Configuration Step 5` (@sec-step_5). Explain the difference.

## Step 7 {#sec-step_7}

### Measure the `numRetry` statistic for `Configuration Steps 6` (@sec-step_6) and `7` (@sec-step_7).

### Cite the source code where the logic for `numRetry` is defined.

### Explain the differences in this metric between the two configurations.

## Step 9

### Plot the throughput vector at host B and identify the time when the transmission stops.
